# Roboto SDK

[Roboto](https://www.roboto.ai/) makes it easy to manage and analyze log data from your robots.

This package contains the official toolkit for interacting with Roboto.
It consists of the `roboto` Python module, as well as a `roboto` command line utility.

If this is your first time using Roboto, we recommend reading the [docs](https://docs.roboto.ai/) and learning the [core concepts](https://docs.roboto.ai/learn/concepts.html).

## Sign up

In order to use the Roboto SDK and CLI you'll need to create an account and get an access token.

- Sign up for an account at [app.roboto.ai](https://app.roboto.ai) to create an access token ([docs](https://docs.roboto.ai/getting-started/programmatic-access.html))
- Save your access token to `~/.roboto/config.json`

## Install Python SDK

If you want to interact with Roboto in a Python environment, such as a Jupyter notebook, we recommend installing the Python SDK released via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/roboto/):

```bash
pip install roboto
```

This will also install the CLI mentioned below. You can see the complete [SDK](https://docs.roboto.ai/reference/python-sdk/roboto/index.html) and [CLI](https://docs.roboto.ai/reference/cli.html) documentation.

## Install CLI

If you want to interact with Roboto on the command line, and don't need the Python SDK, we recommend installing the standalone CLI.

You can find all versions of pre-built binary artifacts on the [releases](https://github.com/roboto-ai/roboto-python-sdk/releases) page of this package. We currently build for Linux (`aarch64`, `x86_64`), Mac OS X (`aarch64, x86_64`) and Windows (`x86_64`). See installation instructions per platform below.

Installing the CLI will provide the `roboto` command line utility. You can see available commands with `roboto -h` or see the complete [CLI reference](https://docs.roboto.ai/reference/cli.html)  documentation.

### Linux

- Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/roboto-ai/roboto-python-sdk/releases/latest) page for this package
- (apt) Download the relevant `roboto` `.deb` file for your platform
  - e.g. `roboto-linux-x86_64_0.9.2.deb` *(don't pick a `roboto-agent` release)*
  - Double click on the downloaded `deb` file and let `apt` take over
- (non-apt) Download the relevant `roboto` file for your platform
  - e.g. `roboto-linux-x86_64` *(don't pick a `roboto-agent` release)*
  - Move the downloaded file to `/usr/local/bin` or where ever makes sense for your platform

Coming soon: direct `apt-get install` support

### Mac OS X

You can either use the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager:

```bash
brew install roboto-ai/tap/roboto
```

Or download the relevant Mac binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/roboto-ai/roboto-python-sdk/releases/latest) page e.g. `roboto-macos-aarch64`

If you used Homebrew, you can also upgrade via `brew upgrade roboto`

### Windows

- Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/roboto-ai/roboto-python-sdk/releases/latest) page for this package
- Download the `roboto-windows-x86_64.exe` file
- Move the downloaded `.exe` to a folder that is on your `PATH`, like `C:\Program Files\`

## Getting Started

The Python SDK and CLI can both be used to programmatically interact with Roboto. The CLI is  convenient for quickly creating new datasets, uploading or downloading files, and running actions. The Python SDK has comprehensive support for all Roboto platform features and is especially useful for data analysis and integration with your other tools.

### CLI

With the Python SDK, or standalone CLI installed, you can use `roboto` on the command line.

The example below shows how to create a new dataset and upload a file to it.

```bash
> roboto datasets create --tag sunny boston
{
  "administrator": "Roboto",
  "created": "2024-09-25T22:22:48.271387Z",
  "created_by": "benji@roboto.ai",
  "dataset_id": "ds_9ggdi910gntp",
  ...
  "tags": [
    "boston",
    "sunny"
  ]
}

> roboto datasets upload-files -d ds_9ggdi910gntp -p scene57.bag
100.0%|█████████████████████████ | 58.9M/58.9M | 2.62MB/s | 00:23 | Src: 1 file
```

### Python SDK

With the Python SDK installed, you can import `roboto` into your Python runtime.

The example below shows how to access topic data for an ingested ROS bag file:

```python
from roboto import Dataset

ds = Dataset.from_id("ds_9ggdi910gntp")
bag = ds.get_file_by_path("scene57.bag")
steering_topic = bag.get_topic("/vehicle_monitor/steering")

steering_data = steering_topic.get_data(
    start_time=1714513576,
    end_time=1714513590,
)
```

You can also create events:

```python
from roboto import Event

Event.create(
  start_time=1714513580, # seconds since epoch
  end_time=1714513590,  # seconds since epoch
  name="Fast Turn",
  associations = [
    steering_topic.to_association()
  ]
)
```

Or even search for logs matching metadata and/or statistics with [RoboQL](https://docs.roboto.ai/roboql/overview.html):

```python
from roboto import query, RobotoSearch
roboto_search = RobotoSearch(query.client.QueryClient())

query = '''
dataset.tags CONTAINS 'boston' AND
topics[0].msgpaths[/vehicle_monitor/vehicle_speed.data].max > 20
'''

results = roboto_search.find_files(query)
```

Coming soon: example notebooks!
