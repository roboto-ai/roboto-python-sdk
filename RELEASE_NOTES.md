# 0.31.1
## Features Added
  - Many improvements to `roboto.ai.Chat` and `roboto chat start`

## Bugs Fixed
  - `roboto actions init` no longer prompts to delete and re-download a previously cached Action template (if exists). This should always happen to ensure new Actions are making use of the latest template.
