class File:
    """Represents a file within the Roboto platform.

    Files are the fundamental data storage unit in Roboto. They can be uploaded to datasets,
    imported from external sources, or created as outputs from actions. Once in the platform,
    files can be tagged with metadata, post-processed by actions, added to collections,
    visualized in the web interface, and searched using the query system.

    Files contain structured data that can be ingested into topics for analysis and visualization.
    Common file formats include ROS bags, MCAP files, ULOG files, CSV files, and many others.
    Each file has an associated ingestion status that tracks whether its data has been processed
    and made available for querying.

    Files are versioned entities - each modification creates a new version while preserving
    the history. Files are associated with datasets and inherit access permissions from their
    parent dataset.

    The File class provides methods for downloading, updating metadata, managing tags,
    accessing topics, and performing other file operations. It serves as the primary interface
    for file manipulation in the Roboto SDK.
